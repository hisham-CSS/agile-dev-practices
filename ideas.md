  **Design Movement**: **Bauhaus / Swiss Style (International Typographic Style)**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Form Follows Function**: Every element must serve a clear educational purpose; no decoration for decoration's sake.
  2. **Grid-Based Precision**: A strict, visible or implied grid system that reflects the engineering precision of hardware and game development.
  3. **Clarity & Readability**: Content is king. High contrast, clear hierarchy, and direct communication.
  4. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic, asymmetrical layouts to create visual interest and guide the eye through complex workflows.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Engineering Blue & Safety Orange**: A palette inspired by technical blueprints and industrial safety markings.
  - **Intent**: To evoke a sense of reliability, structure, and industrial process. Blue represents logic and stability (software/firmware), while Orange highlights action, warnings, and physical components (hardware).
  - **Backgrounds**: Light, off-white (paper-like) or very light cool grey to maintain high readability for long-form text.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular / Card-Based**: Content is broken down into discrete "modules" or cards, mimicking the component-based nature of both Unity prefabs and electronic components.
  - **Split-Screen Workflows**: Vertical split screens to compare "Software" vs. "Hardware" workflows side-by-side.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles, squares, and triangles used as icons and decorative elements (referencing the Bauhaus primitives).
  - **Thick Divider Lines**: Bold, black or dark blue lines separating sections, resembling schematic traces.
  - **Monospace Accents**: Use of monospace fonts for code snippets, technical terms, and data points to reinforce the "developer" aesthetic.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons and interactive elements should have a "clicky" feel (visual state changes) to mimic physical switches.
  - **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex diagrams start simple and reveal detail on hover/click, simulating the "zooming in" on a schematic or code block.

  **Animation**:
  - **Mechanical Transitions**: Slide-ins and reveals that feel mechanical and precise (e.g., ease-out-quart). No bouncy or elastic springs.
  - **Schematic Drawing**: Lines drawing themselves to connect concepts, mimicking a circuit being traced.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Inter** or **Helvetica Now Display** (Bold/Black) - Strong, neutral, authoritative.
  - **Body**: **Inter** or **Roboto** - Highly legible.
  - **Technical/Code**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Fira Code** - For all code references and technical labels.

  **Design Movement**: **Cyberpunk / High-Tech Industrial**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Information Density**: A dashboard-like aesthetic that presents data and workflows in a dense, rich interface.
  2. **Dark Mode Default**: A dark, immersive environment suited for long coding sessions and screen work.
  3. **Neon Accents**: Glowing lines and text to highlight active states and critical paths.
  4. **Glitch & Tech Textures**: Subtle digital noise, scanlines, and grid overlays to emphasize the "digital-physical" bridge.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Terminal Green & Cyber Purple**: A dark background (almost black) with neon green for success/active states and purple/magenta for system architecture.
  - **Intent**: To appeal to the "hacker" / "maker" culture. It feels cutting-edge, exciting, and deeply technical.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **HUD (Heads-Up Display)**: Navigation and tools frame the content like a game UI or a sci-fi cockpit.
  - **Floating Panels**: Content exists in semi-transparent panels with glowing borders.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Scanlines**: Subtle horizontal lines overlaying the background.
  - **Corner Brackets**: Decorative brackets framing key content areas.
  - **Data Visualizations**: Abstract data streams or graphs as background elements.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover-Glow**: Elements glow or brighten when interacted with.
  - **Instant Response**: Snappy, immediate transitions with digital sound effects (optional/implied visual cues).

  **Animation**:
  - **Glitch Effects**: Text decoding animations on load.
  - **Flash Transitions**: Quick flashes of light during state changes.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Orbitron** or **Rajdhani** - Futuristic, squared-off.
  - **Body**: **Exo 2** or **Share Tech Mono** - Tech-focused but readable.

  **Design Movement**: **Blueprint / Schematic Sketch**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Hand-Drawn Aesthetic**: A look that mimics a notebook or a whiteboard session, emphasizing the "planning" and "ideation" phase of Agile.
  2. **Rough Edges**: Lines are slightly imperfect, boxes look sketched.
  3. **Paper Texture**: Backgrounds have a subtle paper grain.
  4. **Process over Polish**: The visual style reinforces that Agile is about iteration and "work in progress," not just the final shiny product.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Blueprint Blue & Pencil Graphite**: A classic blueprint blue background with white lines, or a white paper background with graphite grey and blue ink.
  - **Intent**: To make the concepts feel accessible and malleable. It encourages users to think of these practices as tools they can sketch and adapt.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Freeform Canvas**: Content feels placed on a large infinite canvas (even if it's scrolling).
  - **Marginalia**: Notes and tips appear in the "margins" like handwritten annotations.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Sketchy Icons**: Icons that look hand-drawn.
  - **Arrow Connectors**: Hand-drawn arrows connecting workflow steps.
  - **Sticky Notes**: Key takeaways presented as yellow sticky notes.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Drawing Animations**: Elements "draw" themselves onto the screen.
  - **Drag & Drop**: (If applicable) Moving elements feels like moving paper on a desk.

  **Animation**:
  - **Stroke Animation**: SVG paths drawing sequentially.
  - **Fade & Drift**: Elements gently drift into place like paper settling.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Patrick Hand** or **Permanent Marker** - Handwritten style.
  - **Body**: **Kalam** or a clean sans-serif like **Open Sans** (for readability) paired with handwritten headers.
